<h1 align="center">How to growl?</h1>
<p>
If you've somehow already found yourself on the dark side of music,
you've probably thought more than once or twice about learning how to growl. 
What better way to inspire terror and convey difficult emotions? 
But growl is a very delicate thing ... 
They either need to master it perfectly, or not take it up at all. 
How to learn how to grow and protect your voice at 
the same time will be discussed in this article. So, in order to master growl, you need to:
</p>
<h1 align="left">1. Do regular vocals</h1>
<p>
To begin with, learn to sing on a support, open your mouth and properly manage the air. 
Then learn how to do vibrato. And only after that take on growl, scream and other extreme things. 
"Why do I need this if I only want to sing with a growl?" - you ask. 
Because you need to understand how to make sound without harming your vocal 
cords and you won't get very far on one growl. You can easily switch from clean vocals to growl and back again 
and it will be much more interesting than just growl. Listen to famous vocalists who own this technique 
and you will understand that you need to grow in moderation, because even professionals cannot stand the 
long use of this vocal technique. A growl may be the icing on the cake but not the cake itself.

<h1 align="left">2. Drink a lot of water</h1>
<p>
The best option to drink while singing is plain water (or green tea). 
The main thing is that the liquid is not cold or hot since cold water 
will shrink your vocal cords and you will need to reheat them and hot 
water can scald the throat mucosa which is also not encouraging. 
Remember that juice can irritate the ligaments, milk contributes to 
the production of mucus that you do not need while singing, soda will dry out
and alcohol will make your voice uncontrollable. Therefore, vocalists are advised to water.

<h1 align="left">3. Be sure to sing away</h1>
<p>
It doesn't matter if you're going to rehearse with the band, standing backstage before going on stage, 
or getting ready to go to the recording studio. The chant is sacred. To start loading your vocal 
cords without chanting is to waste half an hour of precious time warming up your vocal cords and 
feeling awkward for your “stiff” voice in front of others. If you want to sound good, sing it out.
</p>
<h1 align="left">4. Do special exercises</h1>
<p>
- Take in full lungs of air, and then not too abruptly push it out with the diaphragm, 
trying to emit the sound of an old man departing into the world with your larynx. 
It should sound like a heavy sigh, but the sound will be quite high-pitched. 
Then lower the pitch of the "last breath" until it sounds really scary. 
Remember that the larynx should be relaxed and it should not be difficult or painful for you to do the exercises.
<br>- Imagine the flow of air that you exhale in the form of a column going from the diaphragm 
through the chest to the palate (upper jaw). Now try to growl, only the growl should come 
from the larynx, at the level of the collarbones, and should not touch the vocal cords. 
After all, they growl not with the vocal cords, but with false ligaments - folds of the skin 
 mucous membranes that are under them. In this case, your back should be straight. 
 You may feel a little dizzy, as the air will run out very quickly.
<br>- Imagine that everything around you is terribly infuriating and try to publish an evil "Oof!", 
Like an old pirate, who had taken away a bag of piastres. You will feel the back of 
your throat vibrate slightly (you may feel like you have a sore throat). 
You just need to learn how to make this vibration more powerful by pushing out more air. 
Remember to drink water, for a good growl you need to keep your throat humid. 
Don't be discouraged if you growl like a little puppy. Over time, your growl will sound much more brutal.
<br>- Simulate a dog barking using the diaphragm. To do this, you need to take in more air and exhale, 
using the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. In addition to the usual "wow-wow", 
you can produce different vowel sounds: "a", "e", "s", "o", "y", "and". 
Over time, you need to bark faster and faster. This exercise is not easy, 
but not because it is difficult to perform, but because others may not understand you. 
So practice when no one hears you. Except for the neighbors, of course ... 
but they have something to do with the fact that you have a huge dog in your house.

<h1 align="left">5. Choose a successful repertoire for yourself</h1>
<p>
To learn how to grow as quickly as possible and not lose enthusiasm, 
you need to sing songs in which you can use your skills. 
You can get something from Traumatomy, Gorevent, Belphegor or Cannibal Corpse. 
The main thing is that you like the song. Remember to soothe your throat with warm 
honey tea after you growl heartily. And find yourself a teacher, at least for a month or two, 
so that your efforts are directed in the right direction ...
